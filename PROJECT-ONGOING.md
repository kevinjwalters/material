## Ongoing Project Managament

While working on your project:

We would like to document your project on the Global Code website. For this, we would like you to also provide:

* Team names (Can be silly, but keep them clean please!)

* A name for your product

* Team photos

* Photos of you working on your project

* Screenshots or code samples

* Sketches or diagrams of how your product will work

### Remember

People often feel like they have to keep what they are working on a big secret, in case someone steals their idea. However, as you will see, having the idea is the easy part, it’s building a working product that’s the difficult bit.

This is why in Open Source technology people will usually open up and share what they are working on. People won’t steal your idea ... but they will often help by testing your code, spotting bugs, suggesting other ways your product might be used, and even developing bits of the code for you.

This is the point, and the power of the Open Source approach, and why we encourage everyone to use it.
