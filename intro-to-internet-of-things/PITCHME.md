Note:
The FitBit is a "wearable" device which senses and records your heartrate and stepcount. When you get home it uploads this information to the internet where you can access it and share it with your friends. FitBit allows you to set goals and alerts you when you've met them by buzzing on your arm. There's a website and an app for your phone.

Nest is a home automation thermostat which monitors and regulates the temperature in your house. It saves you money and helps the environment by detecting when you've left the house and switching off energy-consuming devices. You set a desired temperature and it intelligently maintains a comfortable room for you.
